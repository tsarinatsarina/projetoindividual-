This is my first attempt of making a website. I made it for the
first exercise of the module 1 at my current dev full stack class.
I use my limited knowledge so far to create a website who resembles
old geocities pages, which are my eternal passion on the website culture.
I used containers and classes, effects like hover, text shadow and transparency.
I changed the colors and rounded the corners of buttons, boxes and images.
I used dividers to create a coesive separation between the parts of the site.
